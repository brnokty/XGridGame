# XGridGame

## Description

This project is created to develop a 2D platform game. This is actually not a game, it is a game mechanic, we create the grid of the size we want in the game and click on the cell we want on the screen and turn that cell into X. If three or more Xs come together or overlap, those cells will return to their original state.
